    <h1>My story</h1>
    <p>My faith, family, and friends are the most important things to me in life! I grew up moving between Colorado, Utah, and Arizona and I'm currently studying at BYU in Provo. From my parents I learned the importance of working hard then playing harder and if I'm not busy with school you will find me golfing, skiing, climbing, biking, or skating.</p>
